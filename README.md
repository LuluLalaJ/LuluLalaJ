### Hi there 👋
I'm Chen, an art historian 🎨 turned tech enthusiast 💻. With a passion for creativity and a newfound love for software engineering, I'm on a mission to blend the worlds of art and technology. Whether I'm admiring brushstrokes or crafting elegant code, I find joy in the intersection of these two realms. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you can find me doting on my 🐈 two fur babies 🐈, flowing through yoga poses, or practicing tea ceremony 🍵. With a vibrant spirit and a thirst for knowledge, I'm excited to create meaningful experiences that bridge the gap between art and technology.
