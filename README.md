### Hi there 👋
I'm Chen, an art history enthusiast turned tech enthusiast. With a passion for creativity and a newfound love for software engineering, I'm on a mission to blend the worlds of art and technology. Whether I'm admiring brushstrokes or crafting elegant code, I find joy in the intersection of these two realms. When I'm not immersed in the digital world, you can find me doting on my two fur babies, flowing through yoga poses, or practicing tea ceremony. With a vibrant spirit and a thirst for knowledge, I'm excited to create meaningful experiences that bridge the gap between art and technology.
